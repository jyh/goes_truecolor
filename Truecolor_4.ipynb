The easiest way to automate this is to set up a beam pipeline to process each of the satellite images, apply the model to predict cloud cover, and then save the result to cloud storage.\n","\n","The code for this is in the [goes_truecolor/beam/make_cloud_masks.py](https://github.com/jyh/goes_truecolor/blob/master/goes_truecolor/beam/make_cloud_masks.py) file.\n","\n","First, we get a set of files to process, collected by time\n","\n","```\n","    reader = goes_reader.GoesReader(\n","        project_id=FLAGS.project,\n","        goes_bucket_name=FLAGS.goes_bucket,\n","        shape=(FLAGS.image_size, FLAGS.image_size))\n","    files = reader.list_time_range(start_date, end_date)\n","```\n","\n","Then, the `CreateCloudMasks.process` method is called to produce the cloud mask from the satellite images at that time.  The first step is to read the satellite images.\n","\n","```\n","    ir = self.reader.load_channel_images_from_files(file_table, self.ir_channels)\n","    ir_img, md = goes_reader.flatten_channel_images(ir, self.ir_channels)\n","```\n","\n","Apply the model to produce the cloud mask.\n","\n","```\n","    cloud_img = self.model.predict(ir_img)\n","```\n","\n","Then produce a JPEG image and save it to cloud storage in a file with name format YYYY/DOY/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_US.jpg, where DOY is the day of year, and US is the microsecond timestamp.\n","\n","```\n","    # Get jpeg bytes.\n","    cloud_img = Image.fromarray(cloud_img)\n","    buf = io.BytesIO()\n","    cloud_img.save(buf, format='JPEG', quality=70)\n","    buf = buf.getvalue()\n","\n","    # Write to a file.\n","    t = md['time_coverage_start']\n","    filename = os.path.join(self.output_dir, t.strftime('%Y/%j/%Y%m%d_%H%M_%f.jpg'))\n","    logging.info('writing to %s', filename)\n","    blob = bucket.blob(filename)\n","    blob.upload_from_string(buf)\n","    logging.info('wrote to %s', filename)\n","```\n","\n","You can run the pipeline using the following command.\n","\n","```\n","$ make make_cloud_masks_dataflow\n","```\n","\n","This will take a fair amount of time to run.  It cost me about $50 to create the images for the entire year 2019.\n","\n","## Creating a web server\n","\n","Google cloud also supports a product called [AppEngine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) that can be used to create web servers.  There is a base quota that is free.\n","\n","An AppEngine server can be written in many languages.  We'll use python 3.7, with the [Flask web microframework](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html).  Flask uses function decorators to specify web paths to serve, and how to serve them.   \n","\n","You can see the full code in [appengine/main.py](https://github.com/jyh/goes_truecolor/blob/master/appengine/main.py).  The core concept is in the cloud_masks function\n","\n","```\n","@app.route('/cloud_masks/<int:year>/<int:day>/<string:filename>.jpg')\n","def handle_jpeg(year: int, day: int, filename: Text) -> flask.Response:\n","  name = urllib.parse.unquote(flask.request.path)\n","  manager = site_manager.SiteManager(name)\n","  img = manager.cloud_mask_jpeg()\n","  response = flask.make_response(img)\n","  response.headers.set('Content-Type', 'image/jpeg')\n","  return response  \n","```\n","\n","The `@app.route` decorator specifies the web path to serve.  The cloud mask itself is constructed by the `SiteManager.cloud_mask_jpeg` method in [appengine/site_manager.py](https://github.com/jyh/goes_truecolor/blob/master/appengine/site_manager.py) that 1) fetches the world image, 2) fetchs the cloud mask from Google Cloud Storage, 3) combines the images, and 4) converts the result to a JPEG file.\n","\n","```\n","  def cloud_mask_jpeg(self) -> bytes:\n","    \"\"\"Return the current image in JPEG format.\"\"\"\n","    # Get the world map.\n","    world_img = self.world_img()\n","    world_img = np.array(world_img, dtype=np.float32) / 256\n","\n","    # Get the mask file.\n","    bucket = self.client.bucket(self.bucket_name)\n","    blob = bucket.blob(self.page_name[1:])\n","    s = blob.download_as_string()\n","    f = io.BytesIO(s)\n","    lum = Image.open(f)\n","    lum = np.array(lum)\n","    lum = lum.astype(np.float32) / 256\n","    lum = lum[:, :, np.newaxis]\n","\n","    # Generate the composite.\n","    mask = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-10 * (lum - 0.3)))\n","    img = lum * mask + (1 - mask) * world_img\n","    img = (img * 255).astype(np.uint8)\n","    img = Image.fromarray(img)\n","\n","    # Convert to JPEG.\n","    f = io.BytesIO()\n","    img.save(f, 'JPEG')\n","    return f.getvalue()\n","```\n","\n","To deploy, you use the `gcloud` command.
